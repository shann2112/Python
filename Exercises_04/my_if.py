# Exercise 4 changed all boolean values and ran the code, The value has to be true  for the if statment to run.
# First come first served notion.

#a = False
#b = False
#c = False
#if a:
#    print("a was true")
#elif b:
#    print("b was true")
#elif c:
#    print("c was true")
#else:
#    print("None of the boolean values were true")


# Exercise 4 I added in 4 values to change outside of the if statement.
# With the "AND" condition they both have to be true, If an "OR" is used then either has to be true
a = 3
b = 2
c = 5
d = 9

if (a<b) and (c<d):
