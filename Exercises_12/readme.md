# Infrastructure as code #
This sheet is intended to *demonstrate* some of the features of **markdown**.
Personally I think:
>markdown is an essential tool for documenting stuff which should be readable anywhere, on any operating system.

There are many advantages
1. Easy to work with.
2. Simple syntax, no complicated code.
3. Just good enough for what we need.

When I'm working with markup
- I keep everything simple.
- No waffle and all text as concise as possible.

I can add images by using a link:
![img.png](atu.jpg)

I can easily insert code snippets to discuss such as 
```print("Hello World")```, but personally I prefer code blocks where I specify the language, such as:
```python
print("Hello World!")
``` 
However, you may find this is not supported by all rendering engines.
