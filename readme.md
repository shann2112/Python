# This readme.md file contains Assignment Instructions Part 1 #



>This Assignment is to populate a GitHub with all the Python code produced from walkthrough 1 to 12 which spanned several weeks of course work. A local Git repository was created prior to creating an online GitHub distrubuted repository.

**Repository Description**
>This Python Repository was created to centralise and distrubute Python code and exercise's created by the student. This code demonstrates the basic elements of Python from its setup to some basic and practical code snippets. This repository can be built upon to store functional code which can be utilised in future projects.

**The Aims of this Assignment:**
1. In your GitHub account, create a repository called "Python"
2. Save your Python exercises (weeks 2-5)
3. This repo should be to best practice as per the Python and Git/Github walkthroughs.
4. Create at least one feature branch and merge in the recommended way.
5. Include the directory structure recommended in my notes with a single readme.md explaining the repo.

**GitHub URL**

> https://github.com/shann2112/Python.git

**Branch**
> https://github.com/shann2112/Python/tree/Testing-Branch

**File merged**
>https://github.com/shann2112/Python/blob/Testing-Branch/Exercises_01/CharSlicing.py

**Conclusion**
- An online repository was set up to facilite this demonstration
- A new branch was created to demonstrate a merge to a changed file
- Both Repositories, local and online, were created and tested as setout in the walkthoughts presented by John ORaw in order to facilitate the requirments of Assignments 2.

> In order to verify this assignment part 1, follow the instructions above to the GitHub Repository.
